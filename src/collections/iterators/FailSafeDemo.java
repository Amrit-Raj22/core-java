/**
 * Unlike Fail Fast iterators, Fail Safe iterators donâ€™t throw any exceptions if
 * the collection is modified during the process of iteration. This is due to
 * the fact that they iterate on the clone of the collection, instead of the
 * actual collection. The structural modifications done on the actual collection
 * goes unnoticed by them.
 * 
 * However, it should be noticed that there is no such thing as a truly Fail
 * Safe Iterator. It would be appropriate to term it as Weakly-Consistent.
